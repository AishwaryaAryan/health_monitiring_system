IoT-Based Health Monitoring System Using ESP8266

Overview

This project uses an ESP8266 NodeMCU to monitor heart rate and body temperature in real-time. The data can be displayed on the Serial Monitor or sent to a cloud/server for remote health tracking.

Components Used

ESP8266 NodeMCU
Heart Rate Sensor (e.g., Pulse Sensor or MAX30100)
Temperature Sensor (e.g., LM35, DS18B20, or DHT11)
Jumper Wires
Circuit Connections

Code Explanation
Reads heart rate and temperature data from sensors.
Displays the readings on the Serial Monitor.
Can be extended to send data to IoT platforms like ThingSpeak or Firebase.

Installation & Usage

1. Install Required Libraries (if using MAX30100 or DS18B20)
2. Connect the components as per the circuit
3. Upload the code using Arduino IDE
4. Open the Serial Monitor to view real-time health data

Applications

✅ Remote health monitoring
✅ Wearable health devices
✅ IoT-based patient tracking
